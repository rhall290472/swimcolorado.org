    <h6>Guidelines for Observed Meets</h6>
    <p>USA Swimming rules provide a means for results at swimming competitions not sanctioned by USA Swimming (i.e. high
      school) to be submitted for entry into the SWIMS database. These are termed “observed swims” because the rules
      specify that certified USA Swimming officials must be in attendance to verify compliance of the swims with that
      part of
      the USA Swimming rule that differs from the organization’s rule. While other swimming organizations such as high
      school
      have very similar rules there are a few differences. Observers ensure that where there are differences a swim
      confirms
      to USA Swimming rules. If it does then it is eligible for submission into SWIMS.</p>

    <h7>Swimming Rule Differences</h7>
    <p>This chart describes where National Federation of High School (NFHS) technical rules differ from FINA/USA
      Swimming rules. They are allowed by those organizations but not by FINA/USA Swimming. If you observe them they
      should be
      noted in the observation report as a violation.</p>

            This is a violation in USA Swimming. If a swimmer misses the wall during a backstroke turn in high school
            they may scull
            back and touch the wall. Also, a violation in USA Swimming.</td>

    <p></p><strong>Kinesiology Tape</strong> - Although legal in High School with appropriate medical documentation,
    the use of kinesiology tape is not allowed under any circumstances in USA swimming and would merit disqualification.

    <h6>Protocol</h6>
    <p>Designate one of the observing officials as the lead official. Have that official obtain heat sheets from the
      meet
      director. That official will also assign coverage for the observing officials.
      Always give preference to the association officials (in this case High School) as to deck positioning. They are
      the
      officials for the meet, we are just invited guests.
      Observe only those areas where the strokes differ as listed above. Just step back from the pool when not
      observing the
      above areas.</p>
    <p>While actively observing, note on the heat sheet any violations of USA swimming rules only for those areas of
      the
      strokes listed above. At the conclusion of the meet the designated lead official should consolidate any notes on
      the
      heat sheets and provide an update to the CT Swimming office, the officials chair, and program operations. If
      everything
      was clean and there were no violations (very common) they still need to know.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="csi">
    <h6>The following are key to our maintaining a good working relationship with the CHSAA:</h6>
    <li>Never raise your hand for something you have observed. Simply note on the heat sheet.</li>
    <li>Never discuss with swimmers anything about their strokes.</li>
    <li>Never discuss with association officials or coaches anything that you observe pertaining to strokes being swum.</li>
    <li>Just as in USA-S meets we are neutral, impartial observers. There should be no cheering by our officials for any</li>
