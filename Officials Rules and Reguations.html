A lead-off swimmer’s time shall not be nullified by a subsequent disqualification of his/her team members.  (In other words, a team can’t field a relay team with less than 4 eligible swimmers and get the lead-off time to count.)  Special relays for fun and not for an official team time would not be impacted by this rule.
