<p><strong>TECH SUIT INFORMATION FOR OFFICIALS</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>By: Tom Avischious &ndash; Senior Director of Team Services, USA Swimming</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The following rule, proposed by the Age Group Development Committee, will take effect on September 1, 2020.</p>

<p>102.8 SWIMWEAR</p>

<p>.1 Design</p>

<p style="margin-left:27pt;">F.&nbsp;&nbsp; No Technical Suit may be worn by any 12 &amp; Under USA Swimming athlete
  member in competition at any Sanctioned, Approved, or Observed meet.</p>

<p style="margin-left:45pt;">1)&nbsp;&nbsp; Exceptions to the foregoing restriction are only for Junior Nationals, US
  Open, National Championships, and Olympic Trials.</p>

<p style="margin-left:45pt;">2)&nbsp;&nbsp; A Technical Suit is one that has the following components:</p>

<p style="margin-left:63pt;">a.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any suit with any bonded or taped seams regardless of its fabric or
  silhouette; or</p>

<p style="margin-left:63pt;">b.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any suit with woven fabric extending past the hips.</p>

<p style="margin-left:45pt;">(Note: WOVEN FABRIC-A suit with woven fabric and sewn seams that do not extend below the
  hips is permitted.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:45pt;">(Note: KNIT FABRIC-A suit with knit fabric and sewn seams not extending below the knees is
  permitted.)</p>

<p><strong><u>Age Group Development Committee Key Considerations</u></strong></p>

<p>&middot;&nbsp; Maintaining the status quo will negatively impact swimmer development by continuing to emphasize the
  suit as a quick (and false) path to success versus long-term skill development, practice, athlete effort, and
  coaching.</p>

<p>&middot;&nbsp; Curbing the over-zealous parent mentality of needing to &ldquo;keep up with the Joneses&rdquo; in
  order to compete.</p>

<p>&middot;&nbsp; The status quo often removes decision-making from the coach to recommend the best long-term
  development plan for each individual swimmer.</p>

<p>&middot;&nbsp; While cost was less of a factor than initially thought, the committee is mindful of managing the
  overall cost of participation and its impact on athlete retention.</p>

<p><strong><u>Identification, Approval, and Enforcement</u></strong></p>

<p>Virtually all suits that fall within the definition of restricted tech suits have been through the FINA approval
  process and bear the FINA-approved logo. Therefore, most suits that have the FINA approval logo are
  <strong>not</strong> legal for competition to come September 1, 2020.</p>

<p>There are a handful of suits in the market with the FINA logo that would be considered legal for Age Group
  competition. These suits will bear an additional green checkmark logo developed by USA Swimming to indicate approval.
  Each manufacturer must submit a suit to USA Swimming to gain approval to use the checkmark on their suits. This green
  checkmark will <strong><u>only</u> appear on suits that have the FINA logo</strong>-it will not be on all approved
  suits.</p>

<p>All suits with the FINA logo and without the secondary approval logo will be easily identified as a restricted suit
  for 12 &amp; under competition.</p>

<p>There have been some questions from officials on &ldquo;closer examination&rdquo; of a suit. In most cases, if a suit
  has the FINA approval logo it is not legal for 12-Under use. <strong>The burden of knowing if a suit is compliant or
    not is really on the parent, coach, and swimmer.</strong></p>

<p><strong><u>Communication about the Technical Suit rule</u></strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>USA Swimming&rsquo;s communication department has a comprehensive plan in place on the roll-out of information
    regarding the new rule. There is communication about the rule happening at least once a month this year.</li>
  <li>There is a special page on our website about the upcoming ban. &ldquo;Is your Tech Suit-Able?&rdquo; <a
      href="https://www.usaswimming.org/news-landing-page/2019/09/12/tech-suit-restriction-for-12-and-under-swimmers">https://www.usaswimming.org/news-landing-page/2019/09/12/tech-suit-restriction-for-12-and-under-swimmers</a>&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>Communications shot a 4-minute video of Olympian Leah Smith giving an explanation to parents and coaches of the
    ban and talking about the different types of suits. It is really good and posted at the website link above.</li>
  <li>Jeff Cummings wrote an article about the suits that came out in an issue of Splash magazine and there are
    additional articles coming out as well.</li>
  <li>We recorded and released a podcast with Dynamo Associate Head Coach, Beth Winkowski, explaining the ban from a
    coach&rsquo;s perspective.</li>
  <li>Before Christmas, we sent an email communication directly to most 11-Under parents outlining the new rule.</li>
  <li>I have been receiving a number of negative comments from disgruntled parents (and a grandparent). I have responded
    personally to each of them and while they don&rsquo;t necessarily like it, they are at least appreciative of a
    response. The interesting thing is that virtually all the parents that I have heard from are parents of
    11-12-year-olds and they &ldquo;understand&rdquo; why the ban should be for 10-Unders, but they feel it
    shouldn&rsquo;t be for 11-12-year-olds.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><u>Additional questions</u></strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>If we see an illegal suit on a swimmer on the blocks, do we stop the meet and allow them to change?</li>
</ul>

<p><em>NO, as we mentioned, the burden is on the parent, coach, and swimmer to know if a suit is compliant prior to
    competition.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>What if we notice an illegal suit AFTER the race - while the swimmer is still in the water &ndash; the race is
    finished so can there be a DQ?<br />
    <br />
    <em>NO. It really depends on whether you observed the swimmer while the race was in progress or after it was
      finished and whether you raised your hand to indicate a potential disqualification. This rule is no different than
      an illegal touch. Would you call an illegal touch at the finish AFTER the swimmer exited the pool? As they walk
      away? There has to be a point where you say, &ldquo;too late&rdquo;. The race is over when the touch is made.
      Calling an infraction AFTER the race would result in over-officiating.</em>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do we warn swimmers walking around in an illegal suit during warmups?</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>NO. It is not illegal to wear a tech suit when not competing. Officials are not the suit police.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>It is not a DQ unless they swim in the suit - what if it is not noticed until they are finished but the official
    is positive that they swam a race in the suit?<br />
    <br />
    <em>Did the official raise his/her hand while the swimmer was still competing in the water before or at the
      touch?&nbsp; If not, then no call. One LSC that has already implemented the rule allows the swimmer to bring the
      suit (if it is in question) to the referee for them to look at it once they have changed out of the suit. However,
      if the swimmer is out of the pool, they are out of your jurisdiction.</em>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong><u>Additional consideration for Officials</u></strong></p>

<p>Even though we have promoted the upcoming change, there may be instances where a parent purchases an older stock suit
  that had the FINA approval logo on it but does not have the checkmark on it because a dealer had older stock of the
  suit. In this instance, the suggested &ldquo;work around&rdquo; would be:</p>

<p>1.USA Swimming will have a list of these suits on the website. Currently, there are six that have been approved.</p>

<p>2.Swimmer or coach takes the suit to the meet referee PRIOR to the start of the meet.</p>

<p>3.The tag on the suit has the name of the suit on it and the referee can compare with the list on the website.</p>

<p>4.Referee with a green Sharpie, places an &ldquo;X&rdquo; over the FINA approval logo.</p>

<p>5.It is up to the swimmer and/or coach to have this approved prior to them swimming the race.</p>

<p>Pros: this would help in the rare instance where a parent purchased a suit that is actually legal but does not have
  the checkmark on it due to older stock of the suit.</p>

<p>Cons: There is nothing to prevent a coach, swimmer or parent from putting an &ldquo;X&rdquo; on the suit with their
  own green Sharpie. We have to trust that no one would do this and feel like the pros outweigh the cons.</p>
