    <h3>Officials National Certification</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The National Officials Certification Program is administered by the USA Swimming Officials Committee. Its primary
      goal is to expand the education of officials through mentoring, participation and evaluation as well recognizing those
      officials who have demonstrated their knowledge of swim officiating at each level and position. Certification at
      any level requires a combination of several things including evaluations, local participation at meets, continuing
      education, and the training and mentoring of other officials.</p>
