<h1><strong>CSI TEAM TRAVEL</strong></h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Team Travel Policy for <em>COLORADO SWIMMING LSC</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 style="text-align:Left"><strong>Purpose: </strong></h3>

<p>Athletes are most vulnerable to misconduct during travel, particularly overnight stays. This includes a high risk of athlete-to-athlete misconduct. During travel, athletes are often away from their families and support networks, and the setting &ndash; new changing areas, locker rooms, workout facilities, automobiles and hotel rooms &ndash; is less structured and less familiar.</p>

<p>Team Travel is defined as overnight travel to a swim meet or other team activity that is planned and supervised by the club or LSC.</p>
