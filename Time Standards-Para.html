<h5>This note is from USAS National Disability Subcommittee: (10Jan2025)</h5>

<h6>All USAS sanctioned Swim Meets- must admit Disability Athletes into Meets.</h6>

<p>We are pleased to announce the introduction of the new USAS 2024-2028 Swimmers with Disabilities Parallel Time Standards
which align with the USA Swimming motivational time standards: B, BB, A, AA, AAA, and AAAA. These standards empower LSCs
by providing more autonomy when incorporating Disability athletes into meets and establishing parallel benchmarks for
goal setting and tracking progression.</p>

<p>Previously, time standards were based on able-bodied motivational BB times. The new standards can now be tailored to fit
your LSC or state. For example: LSC championships may use different levels of standards—LSC 1 used B times, LSC 2 used
BB times, and LSC 3 used A times as qualifications for championships. The idea is to compare the new parallel times to
the able-bodied motivational times. The standard that most closely resembles the parallel standard should be used. If
your LSC or state calculates a qualifying time between two standards, for instance, between AA and AAA times, use the
parallel standards to make the same calculation.</p>

<p>We’re excited to roll out the new Parallel Time Standards for our swimmers with disabilities! It’s important to remember
that athletes with disabilities should must always be competitively included in meets, whether qualifying time standards
are in place or not. To learn more about competitive inclusion and how to support all swimmers, check out Resources for
Swimmers on the DEI page under Disability Engagement.</p>

<p>This initiative also establishes a common language around times for all athletes, fostering a more inclusive
environment. Athletes can now discuss and share their progressions, "I just got my A cut."</p>

<p>It is important to note that these new standards were developed collaboratively. The Disability Subcommittee Time
Standards Task Force worked together with USA Swimming's time standards staff and outside experts, including Tharon,
Steve, Rayleen, Tristan, Eric, and Peter. We want to express our gratitude for their support and dedication to making
swimming more inclusive for all.</p>
