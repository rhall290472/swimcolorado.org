    <h3>CSI Geographical Zones</h3>

  </div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The geographic territory of CSI is the State of Colorado. CSI consists of 5 designated geographic zones which are
    set
    forth below. Each zone has one representative to the Board of Directors with voice and vote, who shall be elected by
    their zone. Each zone is expected to hold a summer culminating meet for athletes who reside in that zone. Each zone
    will
    set its own format and qualification times. Each zone will create meet information for the zone and adhere to the
    CSI
    sanctioning policy.</p>
