		<p>304.1 The mission of USA Swimming is to encourage participation and the pursuit of excellence in all aspects of
			swimming. USA Swimming grants the privilege of membership to individuals and organizations committed to that
			mission. The privilege of membership may, therefore, be withdrawn or denied by USA Swimming at any time where USA
			Swimming determines that a member or prospective member&rsquo;s conduct is inconsistent with the mission of the
			organization or the best interest of the sport and those who participate in it. In order to assist all members to
			better serve the interests of those who participate in swimming, USA Swimming has adopted this Code of Conduct.
		</p>

		<p>304.2 Any member or
			prospective member of USA Swimming may be denied membership, censured, placed on
			probation, suspended for a
			definite or indefinite period of time with or without terms of probation, fined or
			expelled from USA Swimming if
			such member violates the provisions of the USA Swimming Code of Conduct, set forth in
			304.3, or aids, abets or
			encourages another person to violate any of the provisions of the USA Swimming Code of
			Conduct.
