    <p style="font-size:12px;"><strong>Governance Committee&nbsp;</strong> â€“ The chair shall be elected annually by the
        Governance Committee from among its own members. The Governance Committee shall be elected by the House of
        Delegates and shall be comprised of at least five (5) members, with a sufficient number of Athlete
        Representatives so as to constitute at least twenty percent (20%) of the voting membership of the Committee. No
        more than one half of the Committee shall be voting members of the COSI Board of Directors. If any member of the
        Governance Committee resigns or otherwise becomes unable to participate in its affairs, the General Chair, with
        the advice and consent of the Board of Directors, shall appoint a successor to serve until the next meeting of
        the House of Delegates. In no case shall the General Chair serve on the Governance Committee. Members shall
        serve two-year terms, staggered so that approximately one-half of the members are elected each year. After
        completion of three consecutive terms, members are not eligible to be elected or appointed to the Governance
        Committee until after a lapse of two years. A portion of any term served to fill a vacancy in the position shall
        not be considered in the computation of the successive term limitation.
