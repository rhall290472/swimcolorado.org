          <p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Calibri'">Maintaining the status quo will negatively
              impact swimmer development by continuing to emphasize the suit as a quick (and false) path to success
              versus long-term skill development, practice, athlete effort and coaching. </span></p>

          <p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Calibri'">The status quo often removes decision-making
              from the coach to recommend the best long-term development plan for each individual swimmer. </span></p>

        <li style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'SymbolMT'">
          <p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Calibri'">While cost was less of a factor than initially
              thought, the committee is mindful of managing the overall cost of participation and its impact on athlete
              retention. </span></p>

          <p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Calibri'; font-weight: 700">Identification, Approval and
              Enforcement </span></p>

          <p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Calibri'">Virtually all suits that fall within the
              definition of restricted tech suits have been through the FINA approval process and bear the FINA-approved
              logo. Therefore, most suits that have the FINA approval logo are </span><span
              style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Calibri'; font-weight: 700">not </span><span
              style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Calibri'">legal for competition come September 1, 2020.
            </span></p>

          <p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Calibri'">There are a handful of suits in the market
              with the FINA logo that would be considered legal for Age Group competition. These suits will bear an
              additional green checkmark logo developed by USA Swimming to indicate approval. Each manufacturer must
              submit a suit to USA Swimming to gain approval to use the checkmark on their suits. This green checkmark
              will </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Calibri'; font-weight: 700">only appear on
              suits that have the FINA logo</span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Calibri'">-it will
              not be on all approved suits. </span></p>

          <p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Calibri'">All suits with the FINA logo and without the
              secondary approval logo will be easily identified as a restricted suit for 12 &amp; under competition.
            </span></p>

          <p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Calibri'">There have been some questions </span><span
              style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Calibri'">from officials on &ldquo;closer examination&rdquo;
              of a suit. In most cases if a suit </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Calibri'">has
              the FINA approval logo it is not legal for 12-Under use. </span><span
              style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Calibri'; font-weight: 700">The burden of knowing if a suit
              is compliant or not is really on the parent, coach and swimmer. </span></p>
