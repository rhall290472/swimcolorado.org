    <h3>Time Standards</h3>
  </div>
<p>The time standards used in CSI championship meets are unique to Colorado. CSI time standards are adjusted annually to
reflect the anticipated number of swimmers in each ability level. Time standards are generated for all CSI sponsored
meets by the Technical Planning Committee. Qualification times for Silver State, Senior Meet and Age Group State will be
published by the House of Delegates meeting. The LC State and Seasonal State meet will be released by the April
Scheduling meeting.</p>
