<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>USA Swimming has set up policies and guidelines for entering times data into the SWIMS system. Times achieved in meets
that are not sanctioned or approved by USA Swimming may qualify for entry into SWIMS if the meet is authorized as an
“Observed Meet”. Approval for meets is done on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>Forms to be filled out and submitted with in 10 days of the meet requesting observation.
  <strong>Form A </strong>is for <strong>Non-Season Culminating Championship Meets </strong>and <strong>Form
    B</strong> is for <strong>Season-Culminating Championship Meets. </strong>
</p>

<p><strong>OBSERVED SWIM</strong> — a swim observed by assigned USA Swimming officials for conformance with
  USA Swimming technical rules in a meet conducted under other than USA Swimming rules. Reference USA Swimming Rule Book
  202.8 REQUIREMENTS FOR OBSERVED SWIMS</p>
