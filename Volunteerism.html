  <div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</div>

  <div style="text-align: justify;">Competitive swimming has grown over the years and so has our need for great
    volunteers
    to
    make our sport what it is today. &nbsp;Virtually everyone on and around the pool deck at swim meets (except
    coaches) are an unpaid volunteer to make swim meets run as they do. &nbsp;<span
      style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Without that effort, we could assure your athletes their times to qualify to
      greater opportunities for all the hard work they put in in practice each week.</span>

      <div>There are many ways to

        <li style="text-align: justify;">
          <div>you can volunteer as
              a
              USA Swimming Official (<a

                Official</a>).</div>

          <ul>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">
              <div>Unlike other
                  sports
                  such as soccer, football, and baseball, where Officials are paid by the sponsoring organizations,
                  the
                  officiating staff at swim meets is composed entirely of volunteers. &nbsp;Many of the Officials on
                  deck have kids swimming in the meet yet many others do not. &nbsp;Most officials work only when
                  their
                  athletes are swimming in a session or meet. &nbsp;Other people volunteer their time because they
                  enjoy
                  the sport and it&#39;s a way of showing support for the swimming community.</div>
            </li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">
              <div>It takes a
                  minimum
                  of 8-10&nbsp;Officials at each session to efficiently conduct a swim meet and (to not overlook the
                  staff supporting the meet) &nbsp;that is why growing our number of officials is so important.
                  &nbsp;Without a minimum number of Officials on the deck, a swim meet is simply an exhibition event
                  and
                  the times obtained by the swimmers will not count. &nbsp;We&#39;ve been extremely fortunate that
                  this
                  situation only happens on rare occasions, however, there&#39;s no guarantee it won&#39;t occur more
                  in
                  the future if we don&#39;t have enough Officials to observe at meets.</div>
